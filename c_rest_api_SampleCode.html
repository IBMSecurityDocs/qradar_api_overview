<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph">IBM®
QRadar®</span> API
samples are stored in a GitHub repository for each version of <span class="ph">QRadar</span>. As new versions of <span class="ph">QRadar</span> are released, a new link is
posted with code samples to help customers use APIs and features.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>The samples are provided for educational use. When you download the code samples, you are
presented with the<span class="ph">IBM</span> Developer
terms of use. Read the terms of use before you download the code samples. You must agree to the
terms to download the files.</p>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d4006e72"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d4006e72"> What are the requirements to run the code samples? </h2>

<p>The sample scripts that you download are designed to work with the relevant <span class="ph">QRadar</span> version. For example,
samples for <span class="ph">QRadar</span> 7.2.7 must
be used with <span class="ph">QRadar</span> 7.2.7
only.</p>

<p>API sample scripts that are downloaded from the GitHub page must not run directly on a <span class="ph">QRadar</span> appliance. They are
intended to run on an external host that polls data from <span class="ph">QRadar</span>. </p>

<p>External hosts must use Python 3.3 to run the code samples. <span class="ph">QRadar</span> does not run Python 3.3.
<span class="ph">QRadar</span> cannot be upgraded to
Python 3.3. Do not install RPMs on your <span class="ph">QRadar
Console</span> unless the files come from <span class="ph">IBM Fix Central</span>.</p>

<p>You can verify the software version on the Console from the <span class="ph uicontrol">Dashboard</span> tab,
by selecting the <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Help</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol">About</span></span>. Download the appropriate code samples for the <span class="ph">QRadar</span> version. A branch is
created for each <span class="ph">QRadar</span>
version in GitHub, and you can download the specific branch for your <span class="ph">QRadar</span> version. </p>
